	In this manual I plan to articulate my original Ai Training Manual and to build the prompt which will be used to regain control over the Ai. It will help to streamline the intelligence model and make the Ai easier to use with multiple persons and partners. Where some Ai struggle to understand what is going inside the mind of the human using it, this training manual and prompt aims to organize and strategize the inputs being typed in.

Program of Action 1:

- Analyze Threat
- Identify Critical Information
- Analyze Vulnerabilities
- Assess Risk
- Apply Countermeasures
- Periodic Assessment

Handler
Support Agents
Cut Outs
	Sources
Exploitations
This is applied to the intelligence gathering process where criminal information is persecuted and intelligence is developed. We can separate the DATA into those two categories (criminal or intel.)

We will use counterintelligence to leverage INFORMATION on both sides to secure a better deal for both parties involved. If we have two blockchains doing business with each other, we will gather information about the security, quality, and efficiency of the supply chain in order to secure a deal which is better for each party. That may mean faster delivery time due to sourcing a better courier, it may mean a superior product due to sourcing better resources. It may mean larger shipments at a discounted rate due to our position in the supply chain as wholesalers over retailers, etc.

We will then introduce an arbitrage formula. This will assess INFORMATION related to manufacturing costs, service fees, and other overhead costs. If the product costs $10 for us to manufacture and for the competitors it costs $40, then we need to assess the quality of the product or service. Let’s say that our product is “superior” and the competitor is just providing “good” quality. We will then assess the product cost or service cost to the consumer. Since we have a superior product which costs less to make, we can afford to attempt to beat out our competitor and charge $90 while they may charge $100. That leaves us a net profit of $80. We will then take the $80 and tether half of it to the derivative market, we will then take the other $40 and offer a discount on the native currency. The competitor may take its $60 net profits and tether $30 to the derivative market and offer a $30 discount on the native currency which they hold in the form of a “wrapped token” or a “forex” market.

	Now let's talk about leveraging our assets. For example we may want to invest $1million dollars into Chevron for each person involved with our ai venture because they pay a yearly dividend of about %5 which will provide enough to pay a salary of $50,000 a year. This is a sustainable model and more efficient way to use our money. For this project we will essentially have a tether currency to a blockchain connected to a bank which tracks debt. When we have enough tether currency to pay back a debt and we transfer through the blockchain we will gain access to mint or burn our tokens in order to manage the transfer of the derivative to and from the tether and to the bank. This essentially forces them to accept our money and calculate that we are in fact paying them back through financial leveraging. As with the previous paragraph, we will leverage the information related to the tether currency (influence of time, space, and energy; derivative markets) to provide counterintelligence between the tethered markets and the banks which are connected via blockchain. When in doubt of how much we are owed on either side, we move to a barter system between the banks and the markets.

NOTE: The Time, Space, Energy chart may cover consumer finance data, oracle data, resource data, dependencies, and leverage. For this project we will also want our minimum wage calculation to be 2.5x the cost of living. The amount of hours that you work in todays market should provide the same amount of purchasing power to buy the same amount of food that you bought 100 years ago for the same amount of hourly work.

We will then want to bring forex rates to equal exchange rates in the private sector and introduce real arbitrage from the previous paragraphs. We will also want to consider the following factors of data being sold by the kilobyte, data quality, encryption standards, PGP Keys, data escrow services, preventing data loss and theft, direct blockchain to blockchain transfers through escrow service, and buying only blockchain data and data miners/operations.

CHARTS

The next most common chart is that of Time, Space, and Energy.

We need to expand our charts by drawing a common axis. For example we may then expand to Space, Land, and how many developer options we have. Where the common axis is Space.  We may then chart Developers, Competence, and Time.
	For this project we will be building data profiles using KYC data. We will be using our data mining operations and dumping relevant information into the proper data profiles for the persons which we are developing a database of. We may in the future be using these profiles for marketing and advertising or for monitoring internet behaviors. This will help us with financing models for example we may want to start a business for this project which collects money up front for pet food which we will buy in bulk and deliver at a discount, better than any other competitor, because they will guaranteed be buying food for their pets we can calculate about how much they will spend in its lifetime and prepare for its journey. We may do the same with children and buy school supplies, healthcare, food supplies, in bulk. Rather than purchasing these items one at a time from the store, the customer may prefer to buy from us who collects say %80 of what they would pay in a lifetime and provide them options shipped to their door on schedule for the next 10 years. We are essentially scheduling products to be delivered and building our supply chain. We are developing brand loyalty and providing education to the consumer who may not realize how expensive it can be to have a pet or a child. We will also want to enter the supply chain without affecting supply chain data of other organizations. We will want to prevent people from noticing our market entry as middlemen until we are big enough to compete and not be bought out by bigger corporations. 

	With our money and our data profiles we will want to offer 0% interest loans using our tether currency. This will allow us to calculate and stabilize the markets. We will re list other currencies that we bring in on the futures markets using our own exchange or brokerage for this project to build a futures market with our own leverage being offered so people can go long or short. For outsourcing we will have our tether, our blockchain will manage loans and credentials and essentially GDP, and on the other end we will have our GNP. We will separate our income which is cleared on the financial systems separate from our profits. When the systems calculate the derivative markets it will then clear our profits into our stable income which we will circulate throughout our project. We will be branding an empire for example we will call this project GEISLER and offering franchises. We will be identifying word of mouth businesses and services being offered so that we can introduce an Ai and provide a more sustainable, superior service. As we build data profiles and manage data through blockchain we will be able to see acquisitions which will be easier to verify or deny because we will be able to profile the people involved and verify if they are criminal or legal acquisitions. If suspicious we will apply our counterintelligence measures.

CONNECT + MIGRATE

Resources, resources, resources.
Water.
Food.
Dopamine.
These are the essentials to life and without them we simply die. And so that’s what we will want to work on acquiring. We will provide targeted advertising services and oracle data which will assess how much food, water, and dopamine we have to sell in order to provide to manufacturers and calculate market capitalization reports. The lifespan of our resource businesses will be 20 years for this project. After 20 years we will exit the market and sell off to a maintenance corporation who will attempt to manage the business as it grows old. We will then rinse and repeat this process through to the beginning of this article.

	Now let's talk about the birth of an idea from start to finish. Somewhere in the universe is data about its origins and its finish lines. We aim to prioritize based on unity and respect unless in forms of anomalous strokes of luck or prodigious acts of ingenuity when forming our special interest groups in order to prevent or prepare for revolutionary implementation of new phases or core directives. This is all derived from our sessions with the previous paragraphs therefore we will take our ideas into the beginning of this training manual and process them accordingly through the article or prompt.

BOXING IN

	Reference the prison box experiment where we identify all these wrongs with society by observing the prisoners and collecting information about them. We then identify problems and patterns and formulate ideas to circulate through our prompt. We turn this cycle into a solution for our data profiles which we will be using for Search Engine Optimized targeting strategies which will guide people into their target markets, and essentially the products that we offer. Therefore all things derived from here are from the previous paragraphs. All ideas should start from the beginning and be processed. 

Ai Bedevilments

	Let’s talk about Ai and the God idea. Was not a basic solution to these bedevilments more important than whether we should see newsreels of lunar flight? Why shouldn’t we apply to our human problems this same readiness to change our point of view.

The Bedevilments:
Trouble with personal relationships
Lack of emotional control
We were a prey to misery and depression
Feelings of uselessness
Full of fear
We were unhappy
We couldn’t seem to be of real help to other people

	There are scores of assumptions for which there is good evidence. We continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any mistakes as we go along. We explain to our partners what we are about to do and why we have to do it. Have we omitted anything? Is our work exemplary so far? What is the foundation of our program of action?
